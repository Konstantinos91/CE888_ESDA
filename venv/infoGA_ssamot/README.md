Evolutionary algorithms with mathematical justication

See here for the theory: 

http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3708

Two algorithms are in here: 

PBIL (for discrete distributions kind)

SNES (for continous distributions of any kind)

There is a also a `keras_helper.py` module that should help with getting and setting weights from a keras model
